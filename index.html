            <img src="/images/American_Mink.jpg" alt="picture of a mink">
            <p id="information">Mink are dark-colored, semiaquatic, carnivorous mammals of the genera Neogale and Mustela and part of the
                family Mustelidae, which also includes weasels, otters, and ferrets. There are two extant species
                referred to as "mink": the American mink and the European mink. The extinct sea mink was related to the
                American mink but was much larger.</p>

            <img src="/images/250px-Silberfuchs_08.jpg" alt="a picture of a silver fox">
            <p id="information">The silver fox is a melanistic form of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Silver foxes display a great deal of
                pelt variation. Some are completely glossy black except for a white colouration on the tip of the tail,
                giving them a somewhat silvery appearance. Some silver foxes are bluish-grey, and some may have a
                cinereous colour on the sides.S</p>

            <h3>Jerboa</h2>
            <img src="/images/220px-Four-toes-jerboa.jpg" alt="picture of a jerboa">
            <p id="jerboapara">Jerboas (from Arabic: يربوع yarbūʻ ) are hopping desert rodents found throughout North Africa and
                Asia,[1] and are members of the family Dipodidae. They tend to live in hot deserts.[1]

                When chased, jerboas can run at up to 24 km/h (15 mph).[1] Some species are preyed on by little owls
                (Athene noctua) in central Asia. Most species of jerboas have excellent hearing that they use to avoid
                becoming the prey of nocturnal predators. The typical lifespan of a jerboa is around 6 years.[2]</p>
